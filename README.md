Python GUI with tkinter
TKinter is used for GUI programming in python.
Tkinter is the Python interface for Tk. Tkinter is an acronym for "Tk interface". 
Tk was developed as a GUI extension for the Tcl scripting language by John Ousterhout. 
The first release was in 1991. Tk proved as extremely successful in the 1990's, 
because it is easier to learn and to use than other toolkits. 
So it is no wonder that many programmers wanted to use Tk independently of Tcl. 
That's why bindings for lots of other programming languages have been developed, 
including Perl, Ada (called TASH), Python (called Tkinter), Ruby, and Common Lisp.

Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is
 perform the following steps −

Import the Tkinter module.

Create the GUI application main window.

Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.

Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.


Tkinter Widgets:

Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used 
in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets.


Geometry Management

All Tkinter widgets have access to the specific geometry management methods,
which have the purpose of organizing widgets throughout the parent widget
area. Tkinter exposes the following geometry manager classes: pack, grid, 
and place.

The pack() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before 
placing them in the parent widget.

The grid() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets in a table-like 
structure in the parent widget.

The place() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them 
in a specific position in the parent widget.
